We are born into systems we did not design.

Markets, institutions, technologies, cultures—most of them were set in motion long
before we arrived. For a while, it was possible to treat these systems as stable
background conditions. You chose a profession, a city, a relationship, and hoped
the world would more or less stay put around those choices.

That world is gone.

:::note
Homo *Adapticus* is the person who treats adaptation not as a failure of planning,
but as a core design principle of a life.
:::

To live as Homo Adapticus is to keep asking:

> What is changing around me—and how am I changing with it?

And then to answer with experiments instead of panic.
