Anxiety is, in part, a side effect of having a powerful imagination.

You run futures in your head. Most of them go badly. Your nervous system responds
as if they were already real.

Homo Adapticus does not try to stop imagining. Instead, they learn to *steer*
their simulations:

- Notice which futures you rehearse most often.
- Ask which ones are actually under your influence.
- Invest adaptation energy where your leverage is real.
